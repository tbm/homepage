I'm a contributor to various free and open source software projects and
foundations with an interest in project management, quality assurance,
community management and governance.  More information about me can be
found in [my biography](bio/).

On this site, I offer instructions for installing and using Debian on
various devices, such as the [SheevaPlug](debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/) and
various [NAS devices from QNAP](debian/kirkwood/qnap/).  I also maintain a
[blog](blog).
