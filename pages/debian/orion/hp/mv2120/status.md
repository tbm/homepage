The HP mv2120 is based on a Marvell Orion System on a Chip.  Marvell has
done a lot of work to get support for the Orion platform into the mainline
kernel.  However, some features of the Orion platform are not as well
supported as in the original Marvell LSP (Linux Support Package) used by
HP.  Please take this into account before deciding whether you want to
install Debian, especially if you have specific requirements (e.g. related
to performance).

Debian 10 was the last release to support the HP mv2120.

The table below shows how well different components of the HP mv2120 are
supported by Debian:

moment, so it's not quite useful on the mv2120</td>
