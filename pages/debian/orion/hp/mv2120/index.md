The HP Media Vault mv2120 and the HP Media Vault Pro mv5020 are NAS devices
that can be used for a variety of tasks.  In the following, I will describe
what is needed to get Debian running on your HP mv2120.

Please be aware that Debian 10 was the last release to support these devices.

<h2>Important note</h2>

Please be aware that a [change in the u-boot configuration is
required](uboot-config) before you can upgrade from Debian 8 (jessie) to
Debian 9 (stretch).  Make sure you make this change before you upgrade!

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

A lot of people helped to make Debian on HP mv2120 possible.  The folks at
HP have been very supportive of this effort and have supplied some
hardware.  Marvell has done a fabulous job integrating Orion support into
the mainline kernel.  Eugene San has figured out a lot of details about the
boot process of the HP mv2120.  Marc Singer has also done a lot of
investigation and has written uphpmvault.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

Even though I used to work for HP, all of this work was done in my spare
time.  Debian on the HP mv2120 is not supported by HP in any way.
