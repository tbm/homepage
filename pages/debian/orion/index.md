Orion is a system on a chip (SoC) from Marvell that integrates an ARM CPU,
Ethernet, SATA, USB, and other functionality in one chip.  There are many
Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices that are based on an Orion chip.

Debian used to support a number of Orion based devices in the past.

<ul>
<li>Conceptronic CH3SNAS, see the <a href = "d-link/dns-323/">D-Link DNS-323</a> page.</li>
<li><a href = "d-link/dns-323/">D-Link DNS-323</a></li>
<li><a href = "hp/mv2120/">HP mv2120</a></li>
<li><a href = "qnap/">QNAP Turbo Station (TS-109, TS-209, TS-409)</a></li>
</ul>

Debian also supports Marvell's <a href = "../kirkwood/">Kirkwood
platform</a>, the successor of Orion.
