Here is a list of known issues and bugs with Debian on QNAP TS-21x/TS-22x:

<h2>Debian 10 (buster)</h2>

* On devices with 1 GB of RAM (i.e. QNAP TS-221 and Fujitsu Q703), the installer fails
because of a kernel issue.  Messages in `dmesg` include `BUG: Bad
rss-counter state` and `Unhandled fault: external abort on linefetch`.
You can [set the RAM size to 768 MB](../mem-768m/) as a workaround.

* The initramfs might not fit in flash.  You can try to [use XZ
compression to make it fit](../troubleshooting/#ramdisk-space).

* There are some reports that LED lights don't work correctly on some
QNAP models (they always show red).

* There are some reports that Wake-on-LAN (WOL) no longer works.

* There are [problems setting the clock (RTC)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2019/09/msg00023.html).

<h2>Debian 11 (bullseye)</h2>

* Debian 10 (buster) was the last release to <a href="../upgrade">support this device</a>.  There's no support in Debian 11 (bullseye).
